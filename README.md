Inside the `ju√ºyter_notebooks` folder you can find a notebook called `data_challenge` that includes the results of the sensitivity analysis. Additionally, we have created a module called `MoTMo.py` which was imported into the notebook as `mo`. You can check out the functions defined there, some of them have an explanation or are self-explanatory.

Additionally, there is another notebook called `SALib_analysis` which is the result for total emissions of a Python package called `SALib` that makes these analysis, but we made a further transformation of the input space. It might also be interesting to take a look at it, but it is not very tidy and we did not included it into the report.
